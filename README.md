Files:

1) CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data and any transformations or work that wre performed in order to clean up the data.

2) run_analysis.R performs the data preparation in order of the FIVE steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s instructions:

i) Merges the training and the testing sets to create one dataset.
ii) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
iii) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset.
iv) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
v) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
